# Park-It
    Javscript (node.js) based parking application

# Proposal:
    Web based parking assistance.

# Mission Statement:
    Develop a parking assist application purely using web based technologies such as HTML, css, 
    Javascript and its open sourced frameworks such as node.js, bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery UI etc.
    
# Summary:
  * Parking is a huge problem in most of the places, eventhough there are applications available in assisting, which is not sufficient. 
  * Park-It should overcome these issues by providing real time navigation to the closest parking space available.

# Outcome:
  * Phase 1: Based on the User's current location, Park-It will show the closest available parking space.

# Impact to society:
  Allows user to find a parking lot with empty spaces based on his location instead of running in circles or
  parking in no parking spaces.
